        <h3>
        TYPES OF MENTAL DISORDERS :
        </h3><br><br>
        There are many different conditions that are recognized as mental illnesses. The more common types include:
        <h5>Anxiety disorders:</h5>
         People with anxiety disorders exhibit physical symptoms of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and perspiration, as well as feelings of fear and dread in response to certain things or circumstances. When a person's reaction is inappropriate for the circumstance, when they are unable to regulate their reaction, or when their worry affects their ability to carry out daily tasks, an anxiety disorder is identified. Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and particular phobias are all examples of anxiety disorders.
        <h5>Mood disorders: </h5>
        These conditions, often known as affective disorders, are characterized by dramatic mood swings from extreme happiness to extreme melancholy or by prolonged sensations of sadness or excessive happiness. Depression, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymic disorder are the most typical mood disorders.
        <h5>Mood Disorders: What Is Persistent Depressive Disorder?</h5>
        Persistent Depressive Disorder is a less severe form of depression. Although less extreme, Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) causes chronic or long-lasting moodiness that ranges in severity. It is marked by a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years. <br>
        PDD can occur alone or with other psychiatric or mood disorders, although not with mania or hypomania. As with depression, PDD is more common in women than in men. This mood disorder tends to appear earlier than major depression, although it can begin anytime from childhood to later in life. <br>
        A combination of factors likely conspires to create this mood disorder. These factors may include:
        <ul>
            <li>Genetics</li>
            <li>Abnormalities in the functioning of brain circuits involved in emotional processing </li>
            <li>Chronic stress or medical illness</li>
            <li>Isolation</li>
            <li>Poor coping strategies and problems adjusting to life stresses</li>
        </ul>
        These factors can feed off each other. For example, if you always see "the glass as half empty," you may reinforce the symptoms of depression. And a chronic mood disorder can sensitize you to stress, further feeding your risk for depression. <br>
        <h3>Symptoms of Persistent Depressive Disorder</h3>
        In addition to chronic low moods, common symptoms of this mood disorder include:
        Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness
        Trouble sleeping or daytime sleepiness
        Poor appetite or eating too much
        Poor concentration
        Fatigue or low energy
        Low self-esteem
        Trouble concentrating or making decisions
        Although some symptoms may overlap, you may be less likely to have weight or sleep changes with PDD than with depression
        Treatment for Persistent Depressive Disorder
        Staying in a constant state of moodiness is no way to live. That's one reason to seek treatment. Another is that PDD can also increase your risk for physical diseases. Yet another reason to pursue treatment? If left untreated, this mood disorder can develop into more severe depression. It can also increase your risk for attempting suicide.
        Antidepressants, such as selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants, are often used to treat PDD. Because you may need to continue treatment for a lengthy period, it's important to consider which medications not only work well but also ideally have few side effects. You may need to try more than one medication to find the one that works best. But know that it may take several weeks or longer to take effect. Successful treatment for chronic depression often takes longer than for acute (non-chronic) depression.
        Doctors believe treatment for PDD is effective with a combination of antidepressants and psychotherapy. 
        Specific kinds of talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or interpersonal therapy (IPT), are known to be effective forms of psychotherapy that treat PDD. A structured treatment lasting for a certain period of time, CBT involves recognizing and restructuring thoughts. It can help you change your distorted thinking. IPT is also a time-limited, structured treatment. Its focus is on addressing current problems and solving interpersonal conflicts. Psychodynamic psychotherapy involves exploring unhealthy or unsatisfying patterns of behavior and motivations that you may not be consciously aware of which could lead to feelings of depression and negative expectations and life experiences.
        Some studies also suggest that aerobic exercise can help with mood disorders. This is most effective when done four to six times a week. But some exercise is better than none at all. 
        Mood Disorders: What Is Cyclothymic Disorder?
        Bipolar disorder causes severe, unusual shifts in mood and energy that affect your ability to do normal tasks at home, school, or work. Cyclothymic disorder is often thought of as a mild form of bipolar disorder.
        With cyclothymic disorder, you have low-grade high periods (hypomanias) as well as brief, fleeting periods of depression that don't last as long (less than 2 weeks at a time) as in a major depressive episode. The hypomanias in cyclothymic disorder are similar to those seen in bipolar II disorder, and do not progress to full-blown manias. For example, you may feel an exaggerated sense of productivity or power, but you don't lose connection with reality. In fact, some people feel the "highs" of cyclothymic disorder are even enjoyable. They tend to not be as disabling as they are with bipolar disorder.
        
        <h4>Symptoms of Cyclothymic Disorder</h4>
        A diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder may result from simply describing symptoms like these:
        Episodes that involve brief, recurrent periods of depression and, at other times, episodes of hypomania; this pattern of episodes must be present for at least 2 years.
        Symptoms that persist, creating fewer than 2 symptom-free months in a row.
        The episodes of cyclothymic disorder are often somewhat unpredictable. Either depression or hypomania can last for days or weeks, interspersed with a month or two of normal moods. Or, you may have no "normal" periods in between. 
        Treatment for Cyclothymic Disorder
        Some people with mild symptoms of cyclothymia are able to live successful, fulfilling lives. Others find their relationships troubled by depression, impulsive actions, and strong emotions. For these people, short-term medications may bring relief. A combination of mood stabilizers and psychotherapy is most effective. Mood stabilizers include antiseizure drugs such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), devalproex (Depakote), lithium, or lamotrigine (Lamictal)).
        
        <h4>Psychotic disorders:</h4>
         These conditions result in impaired perception and thought. Hallucinations, the perception of unreal pictures or sounds, such as hearing voices, and delusions, which are false fixed beliefs that the ill person accepts as true in spite of evidence to the contrary, are two of the most prevalent symptoms of psychotic diseases. One example of a psychotic condition is schizophrenia.
        Types
        There are different types of psychotic disorders, including:
        Schizophrenia: People with this illness have changes in behavior and other symptoms -- such as delusions and hallucinations -- that last longer than 6 months. It usually affects them at work or school, as well as their relationships. Know the early warning signs of schizophrenia.
        Schizoaffective disorder: People have symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder, such as depression or bipolar disorder. Learn more about the symptoms of schizoaffective disorder.
        Schizophreniform disorder: This includes symptoms of schizophrenia, but the symptoms last for a shorter time: between 1 and 6 months. Find out more on schizophreniform disorder symptoms to look for.
        Brief psychotic disorder: People with this illness have a sudden, short period of psychotic behavior, often in response to a very stressful event, such as a death in the family. Recovery is often quick -- usually less than a month. Get more information about the different forms of brief psychotic disorder.
        Delusional disorder  The key symptom is having a delusion (a false, fixed belief) involving a real-life situation that could be true but isn't, such as being followed, being plotted against, or having a disease. The delusion lasts for at least 1 month. Read more on the types of delusions.
        Shared psychotic disorder (also called folie à deux): This illness happens when one person in a relationship has a delusion and the other person in the relationship adopts it, too. Learn more about shared psychotic disorder and how it develops.
        Substance-induced psychotic disorder: This condition is caused by the use of or withdrawal from drugs, such as hallucinogens and crack cocaine, that cause hallucinations, delusions, or confused speech. Find out more on substance-induced psychosis and other causes of secondary psychosis.
        Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition: Hallucinations, delusions, or other symptoms may happen because of another illness that affects brain function, such as a head injury or brain tumor.
        Paraphrenia: This condition has symptoms similar to schizophrenia. It starts late in life, when people are elderly.
        <h4>Symptoms</h4>
        The main ones are hallucinations, delusions, and disordered forms of thinking.
        Hallucinations means seeing, hearing, or feeling things that don’t exist. For instance, someone might see things that aren't there, hear voices, smell odors, have a "funny" taste in their mouth, or feel sensations on their skin even though nothing is touching their body.
        Delusions are false beliefs that don’t go away even after they've been shown to be false. For example, a person who is certain their food is poisoned, even if someone has shown them that the food is fine, has a delusion.
        Other possible symptoms of psychotic illnesses include:
        Disorganized or incoherent speech
        Confused thinking
        Strange, possibly dangerous behavior
        Slowed or unusual movements
        Loss of interest in personal hygiene
        Loss of interest in activities
        Problems at school or work and with relationships
        Cold, detached manner with the inability to express emotion
        Mood swings or other mood symptoms, such as depression or mania
        People don’t always have the same symptoms, and they can change over time in the same person.
        <h4>Causes</h4>
        Doctors don't know the exact cause of psychotic disorders. Researchers believe that many things play a role. Some psychotic disorders tend to run in families, which means that the disorder may be partly inherited. Other things may also influence their development, including stress, drug abuse, and major life changes.
        People with certain psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, may also have problems in parts of the brain that control thinking, perception, and motivation.
        In schizophrenia, experts believe that nerve cell receptors that work with a brain chemical called glutamate may not work properly in specific brain regions. That glitch may contribute to problems with thinking and perception.
        These conditions usually first appear when a person is in their late teens, 20s, or 30s. They tend to affect men and women about equally.
        <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
        To diagnose a psychotic disorder, doctors will take a medical and psychiatric history and possibly perform a brief physical exam. The person may get blood tests and sometimes brain imaging (such as MRI scans) to rule out physical illness or drug use like cocaine or LSD.
        If the doctor finds no physical reason for the symptoms, they may refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist. These mental health professionals will use specially designed interview and assessment tools to decide whether the person has a psychotic disorder.
        <h4>Treatment</h4>
        Most psychotic disorders are treated with a combination of medications and psychotherapy, which is a type of counseling.
        Medication: The main type of drug that doctors prescribe to treat psychotic disorders are “antipsychotics.” Although these medicines aren’t a cure, they are effective in managing the most troubling symptoms of psychotic disorders, such as delusions, hallucinations, and thinking problems.
        Older antipsychotics include:
        Chlorpromazine (Thorazine)
        Fluphenazine (Prolixin)
        Haloperidol (Haldol)
        Loxapine (Loxitane)
        Perphenazine (Trilafon)
        Thioridazine (Mellaril)
        Newer "atypical antipsychotics" include:
        Aripiprazole (Abilify)
        Asenapine (Saphris)
        Brexpiprazole (Rexulti)
        Cariprazine (Vraylar)
        Clozapine (Clozaril)
        Iloperidone (Fanapt)
        Lurasidone (Latuda)
        Olanzapine (Zyprexa)
        Olanzapine/samidorphan (Lybalvi)
        Paliperidone (Invega)
        Paliperidone palmitate (Invega Sustenna, Invega Trinza)
        Quetiapine (Seroquel)
        Risperidone (Risperdal)
        Ziprasidone (Geodon)
        Doctors usually first prescribe the newer ones because they have fewer and more tolerable side effects than older antipsychotics. Some of the medications are available by injection and only need to be taken once or twice a month or even every three months. This can be easier to manage than remembering to take a daily pill.
        Psychotherapy: There are different types of counseling -- including individual, group, and family therapy – that can help someone who has a psychotic disorder.
        Most people with psychotic disorders are treated as outpatients, meaning they don’t live in institutions. But sometimes people need to be hospitalized, such as if they have severe symptoms, are in danger of hurting themselves or others, or can’t care for themselves because of their illness.
        <h4>Recovery</h4>
        Each person being treated for a psychotic disorder may respond to therapy differently. Some will show improvement quickly. For others, it may take weeks or months to get symptom relief.
        Some people may need to continue treatment for an extended period of time. Some, such as those who have had several severe episodes, may need to take medication indefinitely. In these cases, the medication usually is given in as low a dose as possible to minimize side effects.
        What Is the Outlook for People With Psychotic Disorders?
        The depends on the type of psychotic disorder and the person who has it. But these disorders are treatable, and most people will have a good recovery with treatment and close follow-up care.
        Can Psychotic Disorders Be Prevented?
        No. But the sooner treatment starts, the better. It helps to prevent symptoms. Seeking help as soon as possible can help the person's life, family, and relationships.
        For people who are at high risk for psychotic disorders, such as those who have a family history of schizophrenia, avoiding drugs such as marijuana and alcohol may help to prevent or delay these conditions.
        
        <h4>Eating disorders:</h4>
         Eating disorders are characterized by intense feelings, attitudes, and actions related to weight and food. The three most prevalent eating disorders are binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia nervosa.
        Eating disorders are a group of conditions marked by an unhealthy relationship with food. There are three main types of eating disorders:
        Anorexia nervosa. This is characterized by weight loss often due to excessive dieting and exercise, sometimes to the point of starvation. People with anorexia feel they can never be thin enough and continue to see themselves as “fat” despite extreme weight loss.
        Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). This condition is characterized by eating very little and/or avoiding certain foods. It usually begins in childhood. People with ARFID may avoid certain foods because of their texture or odor.
        Bulimia nervosa. The condition is marked by cycles of extreme overeating, known as bingeing, followed by purging or other behaviors to compensate for the overeating. It is also associated with feelings of loss of control about eating.
        Binge eating disorder. This is characterized by regular episodes of extreme overeating and feelings of loss of control about eating.
        Eating disorders tend to develop during the teenage and young adult years, and they are much more common in girls and women. No one knows the precise cause of eating disorders, but they seem to coexist with psychological and medical issues such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, trouble coping with emotions, and substance abuse.
        For some people, a preoccupation with food becomes a way to gain control over one aspect of their lives. Although it may start out as simply eating a bit more or less than usual, the behavior can spiral out of control and take over the person’s life. Eating disorders are a serious medical problem that can have long-term health consequences if left untreated.
        It’s common for people with eating disorders to hide their unhealthy behaviors, so it can be difficult to recognize the signs of an eating disorder, especially early on. Keep in mind that you can't necessarily tell by how someone looks -- including their size -- if they have an eating disorder.
        Here’s a more detailed look at the symptoms of anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder.
        Signs of Anorexia Nervosa
        People with anorexia nervosa have an extreme fear of gaining weight. They often diet and exercise relentlessly, sometimes to the point of starvation. About one-third to one-half of anorexics also binge and purge by vomiting or misusing laxatives. People with anorexia have a distorted body image, thinking they are overweight when in fact they are underweight. They may count calories obsessively and only allow themselves tiny portions of certain specific foods. When confronted, someone with anorexia will often deny that there’s a problem.
        The signs of anorexia can be subtle at first, because it develops gradually. It may begin as an interest in dieting before an event like a school dance or a beach vacation. But as the disorder takes hold, preoccupation with weight intensifies. It creates a vicious cycle: The more weight the person loses, the more that person worries and obsesses about weight.
        The following symptoms and behaviors are common in people with anorexia:
        Dramatic weight loss
        Wearing loose, bulky clothes to hide weight loss
        Preoccupation with food, dieting, counting calories, etc.
        Refusal to eat certain foods, such as carbs or fats
        Avoiding mealtimes or eating in front of others
        Preparing elaborate meals for others but refusing to eat them
        Exercising excessively
        Making comments about being “fat”
        Stopping menstruating
        Complaining about constipation or stomach pain
        Denying that extreme thinness is a problem
        Because people with anorexia are so good at hiding it, the disease may become severe before anyone around them notices anything wrong. If you think someone you care about has anorexia, it’s important to have them evaluated by a doctor right away. If left untreated, anorexia can lead to serious complications such as malnutrition and organ failure. However, with treatment, most people with anorexia will gain back the weight they lost, and the physical problems they developed as a result of the anorexia will get better.
        Signs of Bulimia Nervosa
        People with bulimia nervosa have episodes of eating large amounts of food (called bingeing) followed by purging (vomiting or using laxatives), fasting, or exercising excessively to compensate for the overeating.
        Unlike anorexia, people with bulimia are often a normal weight. But they have the same intense fear of gaining weight and distorted body image. They see themselves as “fat” and desperately want to lose weight. Because they often feel ashamed and disgusted with themselves, people with bulimia become very good at hiding the bulimic behaviors.
        The following are common signs of bulimia:
        Evidence of binge eating, including disappearance of large amounts of food in a short time, or finding lots of empty food wrappers or containers
        Evidence of purging, including trips to the bathroom after meals, sounds or smells of vomiting, or packages of laxatives or diuretics
        Skipping meals or avoiding eating in front of others, or eating very small portions
        Exercising excessively
        Wearing baggy clothes to hide the body
        Complaining about being “fat”
        Using gum, mouthwash, or mints excessively
        Constantly dieting
        Scarred knuckles from repeatedly inducing vomiting
        If left untreated, bulimia can result in long-term health problems such as abnormal heart rhythms, bleeding from the esophagus due to excessive reflux of stomach acid, dental problems, and kidney problems. However, bulimia can be treated successfully through cognitive-behavioral therapy, certain anticonvulsant medicines, antidepressants, or combinations of these therapies. It’s important to seek help if you think someone you care about has bulimia.
        Signs of Binge Eating Disorder
        Rather than simply eating too much all the time, people with binge eating disorder have frequent episodes where they binge on large quantities of food. Like people with bulimia, they often feel out of control during these episodes and later feel guilt and shame about it. The behavior becomes a vicious cycle, because the more distressed they feel about bingeing, the more they seem to do it. Because people with binge eating disorder do not purge, fast, or exercise after they binge, they are usually overweight or obese.
        Unlike other eating disorders, binge eating disorder is almost as common in men as it is in women. According to statistics from the National Institute of Mental Health, the average age at onset for binge eating disorder is 25, and it is more common in people under age 60.
        Common signs of binge eating disorder include:
        Evidence of binge eating, including disappearance of large amounts of food in a short time, or finding lots of empty food wrappers or containers
        Hoarding food, or hiding large quantities of food in strange places
        Wearing baggy clothes to hide the body
        Skipping meals or avoiding eating in front of others
        Constantly dieting, but rarely losing weight
        Because binge eating leads to obesity, it can have serious health consequences if left untreated. Behavioral weight reduction programs can be helpful both with weight loss and with controlling the urge to binge eat. The stimulant drug Vyvanse is FDA-approved for the treatment of binge eating disorder. Also, because depression often goes hand in hand with binge eating disorder, antidepressants and psychotherapy may also help.
        Recognizing the signs and symptoms of an eating disorder is the first step toward getting help for it. Eating disorders are treatable, and with the right treatment and support, most people with an eating disorder can learn healthy eating habits and get their lives back on track.
        
        Impulse control and addiction disorders: People with these conditions struggle to control their urges to do things that could hurt them or other people. Impulse control disorders include pyromania (setting fires), kleptomania (stealing), and excessive gambling. Drugs and alcohol are two common addiction triggers. People with these diseases frequently become so preoccupied with their addiction's targets that their obligations and interpersonal connections start to slip.
        Personality disorders:
         People who have personality disorders have strong and rigid personality features that are upsetting to them and/or interfere with their ability to function in social, academic, or professional settings. The person's thought and behavior patterns also drastically deviate from what society expects of them and are so inflexible as to impair their ability to function normally. Examples include antisocial personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder of the mind, histrionic disorder of the mind, schizoid disorder of the mind, and paranoid disorder of the mind.
        Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): 
        OCD patients have persistent thoughts or concerns that drive them to engage in particular rituals or routines. Obsessions and compulsions are the terms used to describe the unsettling thoughts and practices. An illustration would be someone who has an excessive fear of germs and continually washes their hands.
        OCD Types and Symptoms
        OCD comes in many forms, but most cases fall into at least one of four general categories:
        Checking, such as locks, alarm systems, ovens, or light switches, or thinking you have a medical condition like pregnancy or schizophrenia
        Contamination, a fear of things that might be dirty or a compulsion to clean. Mental contamination involves feeling like you’ve been treated like dirt.
        Symmetry and ordering, the need to have things lined up in a certain way
        Ruminations and intrusive thoughts, an obsession with a line of thought. Some of these thoughts might be violent or disturbing.
        [Self-Test] Do You Have Symptoms of OCD?
        Obsessions and Compulsions
        Many people who have OCD know that their thoughts and habits don’t make sense. They don’t do them because they enjoy them, but because they can’t quit. And if they stop, they feel so bad that they start again.
        Obsessive thoughts can include:
        Worries about yourself or other people getting hurt
        Constant awareness of blinking, breathing, or other body sensations
        Suspicion that a partner is unfaithful, with no reason to believe it
        Compulsive habits can include:
        Doing tasks in a specific order every time or a certain “good” number of times
        Needing to count things, like steps or bottles
        Fear of touching doorknobs, using public toilets, or shaking hands
        OCD Causes and Risk Factors
        Doctors aren’t sure why some people have OCD. Stress can make symptoms worse.
        It’s a bit more common in women than in men. Symptoms often appear in teens or young adults.
        OCD risk factors include:
        A parent, sibling, or child with OCD
        Physical differences in certain parts of your brain
        Depression, anxiety, or tics
        Experience with trauma
        A history of physical or sexual abuse as a child
        Sometimes, a child might have OCD after a streptococcal infection. This is called pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections, or PANDAS.
        OCD Diagnosis
        Your doctor may do a physical exam and blood tests to make sure something else isn’t causing your symptoms. They will also talk with you about your feelings, thoughts, and habits.
        <h4>OCD Treatment</h4>
        There’s no cure for OCD. But you may be able to manage how your symptoms affect your life through medicine, therapy, or a combination of treatments.
        Treatments include:
        Psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help change your thinking patterns. In a form called exposure and response prevention, your doctor will put you in a situation designed to create anxiety or set off compulsions. You’ll learn to lessen and then stop your OCD thoughts or actions.
        Relaxation. Simple things like meditation, yoga, and massage can help with stressful OCD symptoms.
        Medication. Psychiatric drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors help many people control obsessions and compulsions. They might take 2 to 4 months to start working. Common ones include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). If you still have symptoms, your doctor might give you antipsychotic drugs like aripiprazole (Abilify) or risperidone (Risperdal).
        Neuromodulation. In rare cases, when therapy and medication aren’t making enough of a difference, your doctor might talk to you about devices that change the electrical activity in a certain area of your brain. One kind, transcranial magnetic stimulation, is FDA-approved for OCD treatment. It uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells. A more complicated procedure, deep brain stimulation, uses electrodes that are implanted in your head.
        TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation).  The TMS unit is a non-invasive device that is held above the head to induce the magnetic field. It  targets a specific part of the brain that regulates OCD symptoms.
        OCD-Related Conditions
        Some separate conditions are similar to OCD. They involve obsessions with things like:
        Your looks (body dysmorphic disorder)
        Collecting, arranging, or ordering things (hoarding disorder)
        Pulling out/eating your hair(trichotillomania)
        Picking at your skin (excoriation)
        Physical illness (hypochondriasis)
        Body odor or how you smell (olfactory reference syndrome)
        
        <h4>Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD):</h4>
         PTSD is a condition that can arise after a traumatic and/or distressing incident, such as a sexual or physical attack, the untimely death of a loved one, or a natural disaster. People who suffer from PTSD frequently have disturbing recollections and thoughts about the event and frequently exhibit emotional numbness.
        PTSD Symptoms
        Symptoms of PTSD most often begin within 3 months of the event. In some cases, however, they don’t begin until years later. The severity and duration of the illness can vary. Some people recover within 6 months, while others have it much longer.
        Symptoms of PTSD often are grouped into four main categories, including:
        Reliving: People with PTSD repeatedly relive the ordeal through thoughts and memories of the trauma. These may include flashbacks, hallucinations, and nightmares. They also may feel great distress when certain things remind them of the trauma, such as the anniversary date of the event.
        Avoiding: The person may avoid people, places, thoughts, or situations that may remind them of the trauma. This can lead to feelings of detachment and isolation from family and friends, as well as a loss of interest in activities that the person once enjoyed.
        Increased arousal: These include excessive emotions; problems relating to others, including feeling or showing affection; difficulty falling or staying asleep; irritability; outbursts of anger; difficulty concentrating; and being "jumpy" or easily startled. The person may also suffer physical symptoms, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate, rapid breathing, muscle tension, nausea, and diarrhea.
        Negative cognitions and mood: This refers to thoughts and feelings related to blame, estrangement, and memories of the traumatic event.
        Young children with PTSD may have delayed development in areas such as toilet training, motor skills, and language.
        The intensity of PTSD symptoms may vary. You may have more symptoms when you feel stress in general, or when you encounter a specific reminder about what happened.
        PTSD Causes and Risk Factors
        Everyone reacts to traumatic events differently. Each person is unique in their ability to manage fear, stress and the threat posed by a traumatic event or situation. For that reason, not everyone who has a trauma will develop PTSD. Also, the type of help and support a person receives from friends, family members, and professionals following the trauma may impact the development of PTSD or the severity of symptoms.
        PTSD was first brought to the attention of the medical community by war veterans; hence the names shell shock and battle fatigue syndrome. However, anyone who has had a traumatic event can develop PTSD. People who were abused as children or who have been repeatedly exposed to life-threatening situations are at risk for developing PTSD. Victims of trauma related to physical and sexual assault face the greatest risk for PTSD.
        You may be more likely to develop PTSD after a traumatic event if you have a history of other mental health problems, have blood relatives with mental health problems, or have a history of alcohol or drug abuse.
        How common is PTSD?
        About 3.6% of adult Americans -- about 5.2 million people -- have PTSD during the course of a year, and an estimated 7.8 million Americans will develop PTSD at some point in their lives. PTSD can develop at any age, including childhood. Women are more likely to develop PTSD than men. This may be due to the fact that women are more likely to be victims of domestic violence, abuse, and rape.
        PTSD Diagnosis
        PTSD isn’t diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the traumatic event happened. If symptoms of PTSD are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose PTSD, the doctor may use various tests to rule out physical illness as the cause of the symptoms.
        If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate a person for the presence of PTSD or other psychiatric conditions. The doctor bases their diagnosis of PTSD on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. The doctor then determines if the symptoms and degree of dysfunction indicate PTSD. PTSD is diagnosed if the person has symptoms of PTSD that last for more than one month.
        PTSD Treatment
        The goal of PTSD treatment is to reduce the emotional and physical symptoms, to improve daily functioning, and to help the person better manage with the event that triggered the disorder. Treatment for PTSD may involve psychotherapy (a type of counseling), medication, or both.
        Medication
        Doctors use certain antidepressant medications to treat PTSD -- and to control the feelings of anxiety and its associated symptoms -- including:
        Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), fluvoxamine (Luvox), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft)
        Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil) and isocarboxazid (Doxepin)
        Mood stabilizers such as divalproex (Depakote) and lamotrigine (Lamictal)
        Atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole (Abilify)  and quetiapine (Seroquel ) 
        Certain blood pressure medicines are also sometimes used to control particular symptoms:
        Prazosin for nightmares 
        Clonidine (Catapres) for sleep 
        Propranolol (Inderal) to help minimize the formation of traumatic memories
        Experts discourage the use of tranquilizers such as lorazepam (Ativan) or clonazepam (Klonopin) for PTSD because studies have not shown them to be helpful, plus they carry a risk for physical dependence or addiction.
        Psychotherapy
        Psychotherapy for PTSD involves helping the person learn skills to manage symptoms and develop ways of coping. Therapy also aims to teach the person and their family about the disorder, and help the person work through the fears associated with the traumatic event. A variety of psychotherapy approaches are used to treat people with PTSD, including:
        Cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves learning to recognize and change thought patterns that lead to troublesome emotions, feelings, and behavior.
        Prolonged exposure therapy, a type of behavioral therapy that involves having the person relive the traumatic event, or exposing the person to objects or situations that cause anxiety. This is done in a well-controlled and safe environment. Prolonged exposure therapy helps the person confront the fear and gradually become more comfortable with situations that are frightening and cause anxiety. This has been very successful at treating PTSD.
        Psychodynamic therapy focuses on helping the person examine personal values and the emotional conflicts caused by the traumatic event.
        Family therapy may be useful because the behavior of the person with PTSD can have an affect on other family members.
        Group therapy may be helpful by allowing the person to share thoughts, fears, and feelings with other people who have experienced traumatic events.
        Eye Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a complex form of psychotherapy that was initially designed to alleviate distress associated with traumatic memories and is now also used to treat phobias.
        PTSD Complications
        PTSD can cause problems in every aspect of your life, including your job, your relationships, your health, and your everyday activities. It may also make you more likely to develop other mental health problems, such as:
        Depression and anxiety
        Drug or alcohol abuse
        Eating disorders
        Suicidal thoughts and actions
        PTSD Outlook
        Recovery from PTSD is a gradual and ongoing process. Symptoms of PTSD seldom disappear completely, but treatment can help people learn to manage it more effectively. Treatment can lead to fewer and less intense symptoms, as well as a greater ability to manage feelings related to the trauma.
        Research is ongoing into the factors that lead to PTSD and into finding new treatments.
        PTSD Prevention
        Some studies suggest that early intervention with people who had a trauma may reduce some of the symptoms of PTSD or prevent it all together.
