    Counseling and therapy (at affordable prices) : When you hear about therapy  you may think that it's a waste of money  and it's useless to spend so much on it. but we need to understand that mental health is as important as physical health. You will not think twice before getting a Heart Attack patient to the hospital and you would certainly not think about money in that condition. It's true people can't afford therapy  so here we are, we will connect you students to some nonprofit organizations for mental health and some people who are willing to hear you are willing to understand you.

    Counselors, Psychologists, Psychiatrists
    You know that you are suffering from a serious mental health disorder but scared how your loved ones will take it. We students are scared of how to tell your parents as they would say that this is just our phone's mistake or maybe we are lazy.  They would say that there is no such thing as mental illness and we are just giving bad excuses for bad behavior .We can not dare to ask them for money or pay for therapy or even take it. So we will provide you with skilled professionals, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists and even normal people who would listen to you and give you advice that you need and won't judge you.

We will provide you with a structured approach and books to follow for your type of mental illness. but remember you still need a clinical psychologist to diagnose your problem. links of books and websites to read to feel better would be given.
